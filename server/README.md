# My Node.js Starter

This repository is my go-to setup for starting up a Node.js application.


TO-DO list:
- Search capability of people and time stamps
- linking moments to moments, using navigation keys
- delete moments

- Be able to 'tag' users to each moments
  - multiple users
  - Display those tags on front end
- Be able to 'group' moments under the same event

- Set up location data point in events
- keyboard navigation trail



- Create links between moments and groups

- convert the Events column to a standalone page view
  - Draw sketch
  - get rid of the event column
  - standalone event component
  - implement the scrapbook part(?)

To fix:
- Search people
  - Change the display from email to firstname + lastname
